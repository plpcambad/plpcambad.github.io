 <p> Coaching classes provide students with daily mock tests and subject wise question papers and practice material.
 This helps students practice their understanding and application of various concepts. 
 However, practice questions are the same for everyone and do not address personal needs.
Students have a few common reasons for attending coaching classes.
 The most common one being a sense of security.
 Students feel that by attending these classes, 
 they choose a better set of teachers from their schools since they charge a premium fee.
 Students feel that they have better teaching methodologies and that they will receive individual attention by joining these classes.
 Moreover, sometimes students also have a follow the herd mentality,
 and join these classes just because everyone else is. </p>
 <p>As an increasingly large number of students look at coaching classes as the only way to succeed in their academics, 
 let’s explore the world of coaching classes and find out if they are an absolute necessity, or just a trend. 
 For this, let’s start by weighing the pros and cons of attending a coaching class. </p>
